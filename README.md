#Personal Website


On this website I will include a blog, information about me, a link to my GitHub, a link to my Twitter, a link to chat, my contact information, and perhaps links to live versions of some personal creations.


This site uses a bird animation enabled by three.js. I did not design the birds - creds to Mr Doob.


This website is responsive and should be to-scale on any device dimentions.
