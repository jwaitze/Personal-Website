# This is my personal website.
## On it I have:
- contact information
- social profiles
- work history
- some projects
- a blog
- IRC

Made using HTML5, CSS3, JS, and PHP.
Feel free to use the code and re-use it in any way you would like.

## Instructions
1) Create a db and user
2) Edit _config.php to contain that info
3) Generate yourself a password using the code at the beginning of inc/includes.php and replace the one in _structure.sql
4) Import _structure.sql into the new db (_backup_content.sql includes my backed up posts)
