<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is my first live post on the blog I am hosting on my personal website. I think I will normally have technical kinds of posts on this site. In my first few posts on this site, I'll probably walk through the things I have publicly available before moving on to other stuff.</p>
<p>I'm going to try and make quality content and update this blog with stuff regularly. An archive section will be implemented for it soon, maybe a search and tags, too, so it will be easy to navigate in the future when there are more posts.</p>
<p>My next write will go in depth about the building of this website. I will be keeping this website open source. (<a href="https://github.com/jwaitze/Personal-Website" target="_blank">GitHub.com/jwaitze/Personal-Website</a>)</p>
<p>See you in the next one hopefully with more in it,</p>
<p>Jake</p>
